Submission Method (links to all forms on Moodle): o Pre-Submission â€“

â–ª Completing an online form with information about the decisions you are making

â–ª Five separate SQL scripts via an online form

This assignment is worth 70% of the marks for the module.

â€“ If you have questions about this assignment, please post them on Moodle

â€“ That way everyone is given the same information

â€“ That way I remember what Iâ€™ve said to you and donâ€™t mark you down for doing something that I wasnâ€™t expecting

â€“ Any questions should be generic â€“ as this is an assessment which will gauge how much youâ€™ve learned during the module I wonâ€™t be able to solve very specific assignment-related problems for you.

NB: You are limited to a maximum of 10 e-mails per day to avoid overloading

the testing system

Database Design and Build (70%)

Overview

The assignment involves the selection of an asset management topic of your choice for which you will create a hierarchical pyramid to show how the features (assets) and decisions based on information about those features nest upwards.

The pyramid should have 3 levels of spatial nesting

You will then make a list of 7 asset-management decisions. Two of the decisions must use data from lower level decisions (i.e. bottom-&gt; middle and middle -&gt; top).

You will then create the physical database for your organisation, insert some data and demonstrate using queries how this data can be used as evidence for the decisions.

Step 1 â€“ Topic Pre-Selection/Declaration (online form)

Selecting a Topic Area and a Topic (link to online form will be given in Moodle)

You are required to select a topic area from the available list (link will be made available in Moodle), and then provide a topic title and list your three spatial asset tablenames and geometry types and dimensions. These must be nested (i.e. the top level contains the middle level and the middle level contains the bottom level).

topic BEFORE doing any other work on the assignment!

At least one of your pyramid geometries MUST be 3D

Specifically :

â€¢ The top level should be a 3D volume or a 2D or 3D area

â€¢ The middle level should be a 3D volume or a 2D or 3D area (provided it nests inside the top level using st_contains)

â€¢ The bottom level should be a 2D or 3D point or a 2D or 3D line or a 2D or 3D area or a 3D volume (provided it nests inside the middle level using st_contains)

To give you an idea of the types of assets/facilities that you might think about, in the past we have had assignments relating to mountain rescue huts, zoos, cycle hire, logistics/delivery organisations, holiday letting, infrastructure management companies, lost property offices, forest maintenance, highways agencies, water supply

Step 2 â€“ Decisions (online form)

List the Decisions (link to online form will be given in Moodle)

1. Write a description of the 7 decisions that your database will support

a. The decisions need context and should include some information as to what information is needed but also WHY the information is needed

i. e.g. they should not just be â€˜list the total area of all the shopsâ€™ (the â€˜whatâ€™) â€“ but should have some context â€“

â€¢ â€˜we need to make sure that there are enough security staff to cover the mall, with a ratio of one security person per 100 sq mâ€™ (and then in the SQL calculate the area of the shops and divide by 100 to get the number of security staff) OR â€˜we need to find the largest shop so that we can speak to the owner about splitting their space as we need to find a location to store glass for some glass repairsâ€™

â€¢ â€˜we need to find the maintenance times for all the ovens so that we can compare that to the maintenance times of the new ovens weâ€™re planning to buyâ€™.

ii. In other words, you need to be clear on what the information will actually be used for.

2. You should have two decisions that build on information provided by a lower level query. You should make use of VIEWS to achieve this.

a. Create a view for the decision corresponding to the bottom level of the pyramid, and for the decision query select from this view

b. Create a view for the decision corresponding to the middle level of the pyramid that includes data from the view from the bottom level of the pyramid, and for the decision query select from this view

c. Create a view for the decision corresponding to the top level of the pyramid, that includes data from the middle level view, and for the decision query select from this view

1. Create a THREE LEVEL pyramid for this organisation. This should include the names of the spatial asset/features that are at the bottom, middle and top levels of your pyramid

a. These names must be IDENTICAL to the name of the table that stores data for this feature.

b. All table names should be lower case

c. All three tables (assets) must match the tables you declared in the presubmission stage

d. All three features must be spatial â€“ i.e. mappable (they can be 2D or 3D depending on how they were originally declared)

e. The features must nest â€“ i.e. features at the lowest level must be contained inside features at the middle level, and features at the middle level contained inside features at the upper level.

Step 4 â€“ Database creation (5 script files, online form)

For this part of the assignment:

1. Script creation as follows:

a. Create an SQL script that contains the SQL used to create the tables in your database system. Call this script: createtable_ucfsxxx.txt (where ucfsxxx is your UCL login). All table names should be lower case, use _ to separate out any words (not spaces or -)

â€¢ Make sure you use addGeometryColumn to add location columns â€“ the SQL testing scripts will not work if this is not present

b. Create a separate SQL script for all the constraints. Call this script: createconstraints_ucfsxxx.txt

c. Create a separate SQL script to populate each table with data â€“ call this script insertdata_ucfsxxx.txt:

â€¢ A minimum of 1 row of data for the top level of the pyramid

â€¢ A minimum of 3 rows of data for the middle level (nested within the top level data)

â€¢ A minimum of 9 rows of data for the bottom level (nested within the 3 rows of the middle level)

â€¢ A minimum of THREE rows of data for all other tables.

The data should be sufficient to allow you to test out the SQL for your listed decisions. The resulting data for each decision should contain at least one row of data

So that we can test your work independently, your SQL must create ALL the data required from scratch â€“ donâ€™t use any data that has been imported via QGIS / sourced from third parties. The spatial data you create does not need to be very sophisticated in terms of geometry complexity.

All data should use a projected coordinate system (i.e. not lat/lng â€“ if you donâ€™t know the projected coordinate system for your location use British National Grid)

d. Upload a script that creates a series of views that will help to simplify your queries â€“ minimally, you should have 3 views, one for each level of the pyramid that aggregates from the lower levels. Call this createviews_ucfsxxx.txt

e. Create a script file with the 7 SQL queries that provide data used to support the decisions you listed in the first part of the assignment. Call this decisions_ucfsxxx.txt

The answers to each decision should contain at least one row of data

2. Use the provided test system (link on Moodle) to upload and test your scripts. You will receive an e-mail report each time you run the test. Keep this as evidence that you have submitted your scripts.

Some hints

â€¢ The SQL scripts should be manually created â€“ i.e. typed by you

â€¢ You must use the provided PostGIS database

â€¢ The first line of the createtable script should drop cascade the ucfsxxx schema (if it exists) and create it again

All the SQL should work in your schema â€“ e.g. your create table scripts should be similar

to: create table ucfs xxx.buildings (â€¦â€¦), your insert scripts insert into ucfsxxx.buildings

â€¢

and queries select from ucfsxxx.buildings

â€¢ Do not include views in the decision queries â€“ use a separate views file

â€¢ Include comments in your scripts to make them easy to read â€“ use â€” to mark the comments o ** Any comments should be prefixed by â€” (not /* */)

â€¢ Each element (create table, constraint, row insert, decision query etc) in the script should be separated by a ;

â€¢ Make sure that the filenames are correct. The filename should contain the text e.g. createtable_ucxxxxx etc with your UCL username and all files should be .txt format (not rtf or doc or similar)

Upload a PDF to Moodle containing a QGIS screenshot showing the spatial data you create and a 3D screenshot. The screenshots should include the entire QGIS/FME windows (including menus and layer list) so that it clearly shows that the data is spatial and the map has been created from data in the database.

Marking Process

This assignment will be marked semi-automatically (nearly fully automatically), so it is very important that you follow instructions to the letter. Automated marking includes (but is not limited to):

â€¢ Running all the SQL scripts you upload and creating your database â€“ this will NOT be done on the system we use in class, as we have a separate test database for the purpose so it is important to make sure your scripts run from beginning to end o Donâ€™t forget to drop cascade and create the schema in the createtable script

o Donâ€™t forget to use your UCL login ucxxxxx as the schema name o Make sure that all your tables and views are created in the schema

â€¢ Making sure you use the exact table names for the three assets that you declared in the initial form

â€¢ Checking that the geometry for the three levels of your pyramids actually does nest as expected

â€¢ Checking that all your tables have o Primary keys o Unique constraints

â€¢ Checking that your data is valid â€“ e.g. that you have the required rows of data in all the tables, that primary/foreign key constraints are enforced, that geometry is correct

Marking Scheme

Marks will be awarded as follows:

reduce your mark **

Component Maximum

Mark out of 70 Comment/Hint (in addition to information above)

Topic declaration (via online form) 4 You must make sure that the table names and geometry types and dimensions you provide here are those you use in the final SQL. 0 marks for this component if this is not the case. Make sure at least one geometry is 3D and that the geometry nests as required.

List of decisions (via online form) 7 Marks will be deducted if your decisions arenâ€™t actually decisions but are just lists of data. Make sure that an actual decision is being made and is clearly described and is linked to one of the aims.

Pyramid (upload to

Moodle)

Map and 3D visualization

(upload to Moodle) 6 Pyramid diagram must include all the components shown in the Centennial example (e.g. list of decisions, hierarchy of the assets).

QGIS screenshot must include the layer list clearly showing the colours for each layer (i.e. the entire QGIS screen, not just the map). The 2D map must show all three of your spatial features each nested within the other.

The 3D visualisation must show all three of your spatial layers â€“ i.e. provide a screenshot of all of the FME screen

SQL â€“ CREATE TABLE 3 0 if the script does not run as an entire script OR you do not use the correct schema, or if you donâ€™t DROP CASCADE and CREATE the schema first.

SQL â€“ CONSTRAINTS 3 0 if the script does not run as an entire script OR you do not use the correct schema. This means that if your CREATE TABLE script has not worked, you could also get 0 for this component.

SQL â€“ INSERT DATA 5 0 if the script does not run as an entire script OR you do not use the correct schema. This means that if your CREATE TABLE or CONSTAINTS scripts have not worked, you could also get 0 for this component.

Your data must include 3D spatial data. The data does not need to be complex â€“ e.g. you can create simple boxes for the geometry.

You MUST have at least three tables that contain spatial data, matching the levels of your pyramid

Parameters Table 7 1 mark per query that makes use of the parameters table either via a nested query or a join (0 marks if the

7 queries 35 Maximum of 5 marks per query depending on complexity. Queries that donâ€™t work will be awarded 0 marks. Queries where the answers donâ€™t provide useful information for the corresponding decision will be awarded 0 marks (for useful information, think about results that a decision maker who doesnâ€™t know anything about your database will be able to use).

Examples of complexity include (but are not limited to):

â€“ Queries that JOIN information from 5 tables or more

â€“ Queries that make extensive use of spatial functions

Examples of answers that are not useful: a single column that is called count but doesnâ€™t say what it is counting; a list of ID values without any detail of what they are.
